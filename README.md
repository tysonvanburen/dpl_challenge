# Ruby Challenge

## Running

  ruby ruby/app.rb

## Concept

This command line program asks you to name your character, and give it an age.
The character will talk to you a bit.
The character should say their first name
The character should say how old they are
Then gloat about what year they were born
The character also has a favorite number, and color. Any guess what they are? They should always be random
Then the character should run and get something
The character has an energy level.
Each time the character runs to get something, they get a little more tired
The goal is to wear the character out by running him around.

## Issues
